# Hong-Kong-Journalist

This is the final project of INFO 5100 Application Engineering Development. I worked with Yiyin Chen and Yan Wu. This project aims to develop an ecosystem for a media organizations(we name it Hong Kong Journal).

In this application, we designed multiple enterprises with associated organizations in a media organizations ecosystem and created 5 roles in all organizations and 4 workflows between each role to achieve a complete task.

Besides, Java Swing is used to implement the UI and factory method, singleton design pattern and database in Java visual programming are also involved.
